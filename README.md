# The Calculator Package 

This project creates a 5-function calculator, which can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and the nth-root of a given number.  

## About

The calculator module can be initialized either with a number in memory, or zero as the default value. From there, each of of its methods can be called in order to add, subtract, multiply, or take the root of the number in memory. 
Upon completing each of these operations, the new number will be added to memory. If you'd like to clear the calculator's memory to start over with new numbers, you can simply use the reset_memory method and do whichever operations you choose. 

## How to install and run Calculator
If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
